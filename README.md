## Project Overview

### EDA with Sales Data

This project focuses on performing a detailed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a sales dataset. The key steps include:

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Descriptive statistics and data visualization
- Identifying trends, seasonality, and outliers
- Drawing actionable insights from the data

## Data


- **Sales Data**: Contains historical sales data including product, time, location, and revenue details.

Datasets can be found in the `data/` directory.

## Installation

To run these projects locally, you'll need to have Python installed along with the necessary libraries. You can install the required packages using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
## Usage

Each project has its own Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) file located in the `notebooks/` directory. To run the analysis:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Open the corresponding notebook and run the cells sequentially.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/data-analysis-projects.git
cd data-analysis-projects
jupyter notebook
